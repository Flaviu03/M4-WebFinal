        <h2>Kyle "Gaz" Garrick</h2>
        <h3 id="titleBiography">Biography</h3>
        <p>Sergeant Kyle Garrick, also known as Gaz, is one of the three playable protagonists of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. Gaz will also be featured in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</p>
        <h3>SAS Carrer</h3>
        <p>Kyle Garrick enlisted in the British Army in 2008[2][3] , serving in the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, spending four years participating in test flights, jump competition and marksmanship before passing selection for Her Majesty's elite Special Air Service (SAS), where he is currently serving as a Sergeant for his sixth year. Tasked to Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Turkey, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. Garrick has spent the better part of his career hunting terrorist fighters. Kyle earned the U.S. Marine Corps Gold Parachute Wings at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina whilst on an exchange attachment and routinely cross-loads on operations with the SAS' American counterparts, the Navy SEALs. Required to undergo resistance to interrogation (RTI) testing, Kyle was the only candidate in his class to escape the facility and evade capture. Routinely subjected to physically and mentally uncomfortable scenarios, Kyle prides himself on high tolerance and tactical awareness. "Everyone talks about the physical aspect of being in the SAS but my job is mostly mental. Give me a guy who's got his mindset right over a guy who's twice as fit any day of the week."[2]</p>
        <h3 id="currentStatus">Task Force 141</h3>
        <p>After the destruction of the factory in Georgia, Price works with General Shepherd and Laswell to form Task Force 141, which Garrick, now known as Gaz, is recruited to.</p>
        <p>After Al-Qatala released toxic gas within Verdansk, the situation escalated with the discovery of bunkers used to store Al-Qatala weapons. Captain Price later conducts an operation in the city alongside Gaz, intent on preventing the situation from becoming any more chaotic.</p>
        <p>There, from the phone of a Las Almas Cartel soldier, Price learnt that the Las Almas Cartel and Al-Qatala is making a deal at Cafe Granch to transport a high value target to the United States, prompting Laswell to come to Amsterdam to help Gaz and Price to take the Al-Qatla's smuggler in for interrogation.</p>
        <p>On the morning of October 28, 2022, Gaz alongside with Laswell went together to capture the Al-Qatala's smuggler, using the syringe that Laswell gave him, Gaz neutralized the first Cartel guard near the bridge. Then, he went to Price and took the decoy grenade and used it in the trash can in the alley. Taking advantages of the large bang created by the decoy grenade that Gaz used, Price killed the bodyguard and held the smuggler, then he told Gaz to come and help him secure the smuggler.</p>
        <p>But then cartel soldiers, disguised as civilians open fired on them, causing both Gaz and Price to get to a safe location and return fire. After all was clear, Gaz used the syringe and knocked the smuggler out. Then both him and Price got on Laswell's car and exited from the area.</p>
